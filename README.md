simple-brunch
=============

My simple brunch skeleton for Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Sass/Compass projects.

I use Eco for templating - https://github.com/sstephenson/eco

Includes some nice typography presets and Susy, a responsive grid system
for Compass - http://susy.oddbird.net/

## Getting Started
Make sure you have [Brunch.io](http://brunch.io) installed.

Create a new project by running:
```` brunch new <your-project-name> -s git://github.com/KyleAMathews/simple-brunch.git````

Or simply checkout the repository to your computer and rename to your
desired project name.
