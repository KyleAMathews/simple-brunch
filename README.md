simple-brunch
=============

My simple Brunch skeleton for creating single page apps using [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)/[Compass](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/).

I use [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco) for templating.

Includes some nice typography defaults and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/), a responsive grid system.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have [Brunch.io](http://brunch.io) installed.

Create a new project by running:
```` brunch new <your-project-name> -s git://github.com/KyleAMathews/simple-brunch.git````

Or simply checkout the repository to your computer and rename to your
desired project name.
